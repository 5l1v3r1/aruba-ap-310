# Target for archives and DSOs
#
# The variant with EXTRA_OBJS is yet another work around for 
# building multiple libraries from a bunch of stuff in one
# directory and should only be used to deal with legacy directories
#
# Mostly because of the above, DSOs are built from the completed
# archives.
# 
# The logic for installing the library is as follows.
#   - archive is always installed when make it run in a directory
#     that does not have PART_LIB defined.
#   - if partlib is defined, and make is not ran from top level,
#     library is installed.   That allows to run make in any subdir
#     and have expected results.
#   - if partlib is defined, and make is ran from top level,
#     then library is not installed.  It gets installed when
#     the archive is completed, when running make in the DIR that
#     does not have PART_LIB defined.
#
# Note that the archive members are added by the implicit rule above
#
