# This allows to build many things, libs or apps, from
# the same directory.  This is intended for backward 
# compatibility, implementation is not too straight forward.
# It works by invoking make with the makefile that defines
# SECTIONS with every variable defined in SECTION
# set to 'yes', one by one. This essentially works like the
# directory recursion above.
