#
# Objective:
# the entire MAKE process should be streamlined. Also, the
# objective is to make developers aware of the number of
# warnings being introduced into the source tree (either
# with or without their knowledge)
#
# Problem:
# Currently(prior to this effort), the warnings produced
# by the compiler are mixed with the 'echo' of the commands
# being made. As a result, it becomes tough to identify
# and fix all the warnings. 
#
# Solution:
# Except explicitly passed through an environment variable,
# by default, the echo-ing will be turned OFF unless the
# make is for either 
#	(a) daily builds or, 
#	(b) production/release builds.
# This way, developers can cleanly identify and (whenever
# their time permits) clean up the warnings introduced.
#
# Methodology:
# A methodology similar to the way LINUX kernel is built
# has been adopted. Since, things should be shown at the
# flick of a flag, some more variables have been introduced.
# A sincere request to the Aruba Folks is to prepend the
# $(ARQUIET) to all subsequent makefiles being written. This
# way, going further, we can hope to have a 'warning-free' 
# code.
# 
# TODO: Fix this problem in a correct manner. Also, reflect
# similar changes in the deeper Makefiles which spew out a
# lot of gunk while 'make'ng them.
