# adding a new image requires three entries in this file
# 1: lower-case name in ARUBA_IMAGES; must match directory under mk/image-types
# 2: export of the upper-case VARIABLE name
# 3: entry in IMAGE_VARS of the form: <lower-case-name>_${UPPER_CASE_VAR}
#
# 2 and 3 are needed by the klunky logic in mk/core/aruba-image-type
