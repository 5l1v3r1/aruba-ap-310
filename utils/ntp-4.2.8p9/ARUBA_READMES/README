#### THIS IS A README TO COMPILE NTP FOR VARIOUS PLATFORMS ####

Please follow the steps to compile NTP code.

step-1: Check-out respective BUILD.x (x=nebbiolo/shumway/porfidio) file.

step-2: Change "ARUBA_SRC" variable with your view path.

step-3: Save and close the BUILD.x

step-4: Checkout following files under NTP folder, for allowing them to execute.

//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/COPYRIGHT
//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/bootstrap
//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/configure
//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/sntp/COPYRIGHT
//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/sntp/configure
//depot/margot/opensource/GPL/ntp-4.2.8p9/sntp/libevent/configure

step-5: Execute BUILD.x

step-6: After execution completion "ntpd", "ntpdc" binaries will be available "ntp-4.2.8p9/ntpd" and "ntp-4.2.8p9/ntpdc" folders respectively.

step-7: After you are done with your work, revert files that were checked out in step-1 and step-4 files.
